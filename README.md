# Magisk-BlockAdsHosts
A Magisk module utilizing a hosts file to block ads.

Warning: Do not use this with Magiskâ€™s built-in Systemless Hosts, as it may cause a bootloop.

This project uses the hosts file from [StevenBlack Hosts](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts), whose powerful ad blocking capabilities are crucial to our project. Special thanks to StevenBlack for their contribution!
